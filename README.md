# PyFantasyFootball
## A package designed to gather NFL player statistics for easy analysis
Clean NFL data is hard to come by, and this package aims to alleviate the pain in gathering it. Essentially, this package scrapes the Pro Football Reference website and formats the data nicely into [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) dataframes. This is a very much unofficial method of gathering data throguh PFR, so please use at your own risk.
